Contact Manager App

Welcome to our Contact Manager App! Whether you're a tech enthusiast or just someone looking for an easy way to keep your contacts organized, we've got you covered. Let's dive in and explore what makes our app tick!

Express Project Setup
Behind the scenes, our Contact Manager App is powered by Node.js and Express.js. Think of Express.js as the engine that drives our app, handling all the heavy lifting when it comes to serving web pages and processing requests.

Creating Express Server
When you open our app, what you're really doing is firing up our Express server. It's like the control tower at an airport, directing traffic and making sure everything runs smoothly.

ThunderClient Setup
To make sure our app works as expected, we've included instructions on how to use ThunderClient, a tool that lets us test all the different parts of our app. It's like having a bunch of super helpful assistants who double-check everything to make sure it's perfect.


MongoDB Setup
Under the hood, our app relies on MongoDB to store all your precious contact information. It's like having a super organized filing cabinet where everything is neatly sorted and easy to find.

Mongoose Schema
To make sure everything stays organized in MongoDB, we use Mongoose Schema. It's like having a blueprint that tells our app exactly how to structure and store your data.

CRUD API
Our app follows a simple mantra: Create, Read, Update, Delete. It's like having a magic wand that lets you add, view, edit, and remove contacts with just a flick of your wrist.

Registration and Login
Want to keep your contacts safe and sound? Just sign up for an account and log in. It's like having your own personal vault where only you can access your precious contacts.

User Authentication
To make sure only you can access your contacts, we've implemented user authentication. It's like having a bouncer at the door who checks your ID before letting you in.


Sign/Verify JWT Token
To keep things extra secure, we use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to verify your identity. It's like having a special stamp that proves you're legit whenever you make a request.

Protected Router
Certain parts of our app are off-limits to unauthorized users. It's like having a VIP section at a party where only the coolest people get access.

API Token
Once you're logged in, we'll give you a special API token that you can use to access our app's features. It's like having a golden ticket that unlocks all the best parts of the app.
